@article{Currie2014,
abstract = {Many common models of mortality can be expressed compactly in the language of either generalized linear models or generalized non-linear models. The R language provides a description of these models which parallels the usual algebraic definitions but has the advantage of a transparent and flexible model specification. We compare eight model structures for mortality. For each structure, we consider (a) the Poisson models for the force of mortality with both log and logit link functions and (b) the binomial models for the rate of mortality with logit and complementary log–log link functions. Part of this work shows how to extend the usual smooth two-dimensional P-spline model for the force of mortality with Poisson error and log link to the other smooth two-dimensional P-spline models with Poisson and binomial errors defined in (a) and (b). Our comments are based on the results of fitting these models to data from six countries:Australia, France, Japan, Sweden, UK and USA. We also discuss the possibility of forecasting with these models; in particular, the introduction of cohort terms generally leads to an improvement in overall fit, but can also make forecasting with these models problematic.},

abstract = {The gnm package provides facilities for fitting generalized nonlinear models, i.e., regression models in which the link- transformed mean is described as a sum of predictor terms, some of which may be non-linear in the unknown parameters. Linear and generalized linear models, as handled by the lm and glm functions in R, are included in the class of generalized nonlinear models, as the special case in which there is no nonlinear term. This document gives an extended overview of the gnm package, with some examples of applications. The primary package documentation in the form of standard help pages, as viewed in R by, for example, ?gnm or help(gnm), is supplemented rather than replaced by the present document. We begin below with a preliminary note (Section 2) on some ways in which the gnm package extends R’s facilities for specifying, fitting and working with generalized linear models. Then (Section 3 onwards) the facilities for nonlinear terms are introduced, explained and exemplified.},

In this article, we show how applying trend models from non-life claims reserving to age-period-cohort mortality trends provides new insight in estimating mortality improvement and quantifying its uncertainty.

The effects are distinct in the sense that they are not conjoined with age coefficients, borrowing from regression terminology, we denote them as main effects. Mortality models in this framework for age-period, age-cohort and age-period-cohort effects are assessed using national population mortality data from Norway and Australia to show the relative significance of cohort effects as compared to period effects. Results are compared with the traditional Lee?Carter model. The bilinear period effect in the Lee?Carter model is shown to resemble a main cohort effect in these trend models.

Often, variables possess a grouping structure, and the relevant selection problem is that of selecting groups, not individual variables. The group lasso has been proposed as a way of extending the ideas of the lasso to the problem of group selection. Nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP have been proposed and shown to have several advantages over the lasso; these penalties may also be extended to the group selection problem, giving rise to group SCAD and group MCP methods. Here, we describe algorithms for fitting these models stably and efficiently. In addition, we present simulation results and real data examples comparing and contrasting the statistical properties of these methods.},
